3. Utility lives?
 
Utility is used in courses I conduct at Blekinge Institute of Technology, Sweden. It lives as long
as its useful. No need for eternal life.
 
The course-blog is available here (pure swedish, use google translate...).

The course has a irc-channel. I'm in there.

Free software. No warranty.
 
 
5. Utility, The attitude
 
One must have attitude. Or a philosophy. Perhaps like this?

That works for now.
 
Enjoy.
